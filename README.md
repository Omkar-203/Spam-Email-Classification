# 📧 Spam Email Detection and Reporting System

This project implements a **Spam Email Classification** system using **Logistic Regression** in **Python**. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a Kaggle dataset to classify emails as spam or non-spam with high accuracy. Ideal for understanding how machine learning can be used to improve email filtering and reduce spam.

## 🚀 Features

- Built a **Logistic Regression** model for binary classification (spam / not spam)
- **Preprocessed and cleaned** email text using NLP techniques
- Applied **text vectorization (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer)** for feature extraction
- Achieved **96% accuracy** on test data
- Evaluated model on **real-world email samples** to verify robustness
- Ready for integration into spam filtering pipelines or email clients

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- NLTK / re (Regex for cleaning)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Kaggle Dataset

## 📂 Dataset

- Public spam email dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Contains labeled email messages for supervised learning
